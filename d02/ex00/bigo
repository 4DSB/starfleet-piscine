O(n(n+1)/2) time, this is the worst case complexity. n is the number of inputs
The complexity will be musg less than this as I have 2 optimizations. 
1. The algorithm never goes past the last swap 
2. keeps a track if there are no swaps, the list is already sorted.
O(1) space, I am allocating contant space.
